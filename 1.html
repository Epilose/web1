  <h2>What I want to do in the future 난 용서</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="futureplans">
  I want to live a fufilling life.</a> <strong>I just want to be <u>happy</u>.</strong> We were both young when I first saw you
  I close my eyes and the flashback starts
  I'm standin' there
  On a balcony in summer air
  <br><br>See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
  See you make your way through the crowd
  And say, "Hello"
  Little did I know</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px">That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
  And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
  And I was cryin' on the staircase
  Beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said</p>
  Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
  I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
  You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
  It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
